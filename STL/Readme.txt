Read the assmebling instructions in wiki thoroughly beforehand to understand how things are assembled. 

miniBody1 and miniBody2 shows the dimensions of the wooden frame. You can print them, but wooden ones are faster to make and has better strengh along the fiber direction. 

miniThigh holds the servo arm and allows it slide in the track. A spring pushes the servo arm in position. Check the assembling instructions for details.

miniToe is an old solution to increase friction. It should be printed with rubber-like soft material. 
I'm going to re-design a finger thimble like toe to replace it. 

Use M2 self-tapping screws to fix the frame and parts.
