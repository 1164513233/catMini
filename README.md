# catMini
This is the course repository for catMini.

Structure
* Images/blockDiagram.png shows the circuit connection for catMini
* The test* folders with Arduino sketches are used for testing individual components' connections.
* writeConst folder contains the sketch to be uploaded to Arduino for storing calibration data
* catMini is the final sketch to be uploaded

This repo is obsolete since I've moved to my official repo for OpenCat: https://github.com/PetoiCamp/OpenCat
You can still find something interesting here.
